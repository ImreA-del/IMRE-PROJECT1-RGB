# IMRE-PROJECT1-RGB

This is my first project made using the Arduino Uno R3 

First to complete this project one must acquire the following items either from the Arduino Uno R3 Super Starter Kit or purchasing them seperately 
- X1 Arduino Uno R3
- X6 Male to Male Jumper Cables
- X3 220ohms Resistors
- X1 RGB light
- X1 SOLDERLESS BREADBOARD (OR SOLDERED IF WANTED)

First in this project I connected all the required items PROPERLY, then began to write the script using Arudino Uno Software.
The goal in this project was to control the RGB LED by changing its color in sequence:
1. Red  
2. Green  
3. A custom color â€” in this case, PURPLE

What I learned in this project 
- How to properly wire the RGB without burning it out or shorting the UNO R3
- How PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) works with color mixing
- Writing and uploading code to the Arduino Uno R3
